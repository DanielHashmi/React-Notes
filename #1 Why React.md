# Why React?

- React gives us variables to put inside html instead of using DOM Manipulation.

- We can use state variables which means that once we update the state variable, it will be updated across everywhere it is being used.

- We can split our app into multiple components and reuse those components.

- React uses a virtual DOM to efficiently update the UI which is better than updating content using DOM Manipulation

- Debugging and maintainance is easy
